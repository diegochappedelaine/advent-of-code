# Advent of code

Solutions for [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) written in TypeScript.

## Getting started

This project uses [Deno](https://deno.land/). Make sure to have it installed on your machine before getting started.

### Installation

Using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (macOS):

```bash
$> brew install deno
```

Alternatively, you can use one of the [other installation methods](https://deno.land/manual@v1.28.3/getting_started/installation) provided by Deno.

### Running the code

To run a solution for a specific day, use the following command, replacing <day> with the day you want to run:

```bash
$> yarn solution <year> <day>
```

### Adding a solution

To add a solution for a specific day, use the following command, replacing <day> and <year>:

```bash
$> yarn new <year> <day>         
```

This command will create a new directory for the solution and initialize it with the necessary files. It will also add the solution to the list of available solutions so that it can be run.
